# Daily gamma exposure on market move

### Options: 

The option are contracts that give the bearer the right, not the obligation, to either buy or sell an amount of some underlying assets

### There two types of call options:
### Call Options:
call options are type of option that increases in value when a stock rises
So, call option gives you the right, but not requirement to buy a stock at a pecific price or stricke price by sepecific date, at the option's expiration.
keep in mind one call option contract controls x numbers of shares i.e a 100

### Put options:
Put options are a type of option that increases in value as a stock falls. 
A put option gives the right, but not the obligatio, to sell a stock at a specific price or stricke price by specific time, at the option's expiration.

### There are two componemt to maseaure in our analysis in options market:
### The Greeks: 
### Delta Hedge coverage: is when the I buy a contracts of puts with opion delta = +50 from i.e Robinhood. when the underlying stock moves by a dollars the underlying options move by 0.50 cents. so now the marker maker as CME (Chicago Marcentile Exchan) the dealer comes in place to hedge delta shortage by selling more shares to make delta neutral in our example 50 shares per numbers of contracts has  sold.


As Stock moves and adjust daily the s&500 goes up and down, so dealer needs to adjust their hedings and that's the gamma hedge component and that's what we need to measure.
### Gamma Hedge : As stock moves 

Higher : Dealer buys back short shares
Lower : Dealer shorts more shares 

When the trader closes his position, or it expires:
Market maker has no options position, and must buy back  short hedges

# Long call options Trading increases if stock goes up then the value of call option goes up as well, there are other things affects the price of an option:

### Implied Volatility if goes up the value of call option goes up as well and vis versa 
### Time decay: every call option has an experation date, as the time left over decreases the value of call option goes down

There is another part for call option equal to intrinsic value plus extrinsic value, so intrinsic value go up when stock goes up, on the other hand extrinsic values
depend on implied volatility and time decay.
intrinsic value equal to share price minus stricke price

# Long put options Trading when stock decreases the put option increases basically we profit from price declinations, we still deal with same affects as long call options but the only diffrence is value of put equal to stricke price minus share price
